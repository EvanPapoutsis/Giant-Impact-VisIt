generator.py should be run in the VisIt terminal using the command:
>> Source("generator.py")
Note that due to variable opacity functions this code only works in VisIt versions 3.1.4 and above.

To generate the video from the outputted images, ffmpeg.sh should be run from whatever directory the files were saved to.
